									<h2>Boeing Search and Rescue Hexacopter Capstone Project</h2>
									<p>Our objective was to design, build, and test an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or drone) equipped with
									a system that enables stable landing on uneven terrain, for the purpose of locating a survivor in a rugged 
									environment and providing temporary aid. Check out the design page <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/lfshowcasesp20/2020/04/29/search-and-rescue-drone-with-adaptive-landing-gear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, where all of our final documentation is on display.</p>

								<p>Throughout the semester, the Penn State team has put an enormous amount of effort into the design and construction of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with adaptive landing gear. The goal of the project was to provide a low-cost solution that could assist disaster management organizations such as the National Parks Service in performing critical search and rescue missions. The team's design features a set of adaptive landing legs that allow the UAV to land and provide aid to people on terrain that would be considered too extreme for existing UAV solutions. The project is now completed, and the team is proud of what they accomplished in the face of the challenges presented by COVID-19. </p>
								<p>The physical construction and testing of the UAV was able to continue without much deviation from the original plan. The team had ordered its UAV parts early and had planned to build it together after spring break. However, due to the restrictions put in place by the recent pandemic, the construction and testing was put into the hands of one team member. The $642.22 worth of UAV components were assembled and programmed successfully, resulting in a completely functional UAV with safety measures such as a kill switch and propeller guards. Physical testing confirmed that this UAV was indeed able to transmit live video, tilt the camera responding to user input, display required telemetry, and remain safely operable at distances greater than 100 meters.</p>
								<p>The team had planned to manufacture the landing gear design using the Penn State Learning Factory after returning to school from spring break. The closing of school facilities left the team without the means required to physically construct the landing gear prototype. Instead, the team shifted to a more rigorous digital design verification process, using SolidWorks' advanced analytical tools and simulation capabilities. Through these tests the team concluded that our landing gear design would be able to handle all its terrain landing requirements, while only falling a little short on shock absorbing capabilities.</p>
								<p>The project sponsor, Boeing, has indicated that they are very satisfied and impressed with our results. The team believes that the needs of the customer, the ME 440 class, and the Learning Factory, have been met successfully. The project was completed on schedule and under budget. The team had a great experience working together this semester and is extremely proud of what it has accomplished. </p>
