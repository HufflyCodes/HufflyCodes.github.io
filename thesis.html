									<h2>How do you land a nano-quadcopter on the ceiling?</h2>
									<p>The answer to that question is highly debateable, especially amongst the members in our lab.	However, the way we thought of trying to solve that issue is by taking inspiration from biology, specifically an insect most would consider a pest, a fly.</p>
								<iframe style="border:1; display: block; margin:auto" width="630" height="473" src="https://youtube.com/embed/fmDbaHJ15O8"></iframe>
								<p>In terms of engineered flight we still have plenty to learn from nature, and this project is only one aspect where human engineered flight and robotics can improve with a little help from evolution. Because flies are considered pests not many take the time to think about how even though their brain is the size of the head of a needle they are	still able to complete impressive aerial manuevers. Because of this the main goal of this project is to take inspiration from blue bottle flies and implement an inverted landing strategy on a nano-quadcopter. In order to complete this task the first question is well where do you even start adapting an acrobatic flier onto an under actuated quadcopter?</p>
								<p>Well when this project was first shown to me by my mentor Bryan it seemed as if he had already solved this problem, which can be seen in the youtube video above. His initial work had already granted him the ability to apply a learned control policy onto the quadcopter enabling it to successfully and reliably land on the ceiling. However, it came with one big caveat, this was all done with a motion capture system that fed global state data to the hardware. Which means that while the hardware is able to complete this impressive acrobatic manuever autonomously in the blink of an eye it still required external help, and in the world of drone technology that is not applicable for anything in the field.</p>
								<p>Ultimately those drawbacks enabled me to work towards removing that reliance of external positioning. Throughout this project I learned so much in the realm of software engineering and the Robot Operating System, which enabled me to finish my work where I validated experimental results with model prediction and generated a research plan to further improve the implemented algorithm. I also tested the computer vision model in a simulation-based reinforcement learning environment and benchmarked results against previous academic works.</p>
								<p>If you would like to read more about my project my thesis can be found <a href="https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/23919wch5098">here!</a> Below is my abstract.</p>
								<blockquote>Unmanned aerial vehicles have become increasingly prevalent in a multitude of industries across the globe. However, many challenges prevent their wide adoption, specifically their limited flight time. In order to alleviate this problem, previous work done by Habas et al implemented an inverted landing strategy using bio-inspired visual cues that were calculated with external positioning. This thesis extends the previous work by estimating these visual cues on-board the micro unmanned aerial vehicle. Additionally, the limits of the developed on-board visual cue estimation algorithm are explored in regards to ceiling pattern, frame rate, and computational load. Once the visual cue algorithm was explored, it was run through the same reinforcement learning algorithm from Habas et al to determine the landing robustness. In nature inverted landing maneuvers are observed in several organisms such as flies, bees, and bats. In this thesis, the maneuvers observed in blue bottle flies are used as inspiration to achieve the inverted landings for a small quad-copter. In order to implement the inverted landing strategy, two biological cues are used, time to contact and optical flow. Specifically, for the blue bottle fly, time to contact determines when the flip maneuver should initiate, while optical flow helps with the final landing phase. To emulate these biological cues the Horn and Schunck method is employed to segment image data from an onboard camera. The major contribution of this work is to explore the main variables that introduce error due to the onboard noisy sensors and how they affect landing performance. In order to explore these variables the algorithm testing and the landing policy learning were conducted in a physics-based simulation. Future work will then be done in order to experimentally determine the landing robustness of the implemented algorithm.</blockquote>
