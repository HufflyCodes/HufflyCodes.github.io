									<h2>Automated Rescue Robot Competition</h2>
									<p>The story behind how this project ended up looking more like a craft night is one filled with a sleepless night and a lot of luck. Somehow still we managed to take home first place!</p>

								<p>Through a lot of trials and inconsistent issues we managed to overcome all of them and the final product performed better than all of us hoped. From a complicated computer algorithm involving multiple processors and sensors to an extremely simple mechanical construction we never expected the latter to do better. The reason we ended up going with this design was because after weeks of testing all of the individual algorithms we could not get them to work as one system. Although this wasn't because something was wrong with our code, something even more frustrating, an obscure hardware issue that lead to sporadic communication issues. Thankfully my team was very quick to adopt a design I had been working on in my head because of my worries over the programs not playing nice together. Thankfully even though our final project is not something I would normally be proud to show off (because it looks ridiculous). However, because this project was patched together in a single night of no sleep and it managed to outperform all of the other extremely complicated and clever designs it was an eye opening experience that taught all of us that sometimes simple is the best route.</p> 
								<p>Through this we learned that just because something worked in the past that it does not necessarily mean that it will continue to work in the future. For us that was the serial communication between the Pi and the Arduino. The most frustrating part of this was that our issues were similar to other students in the class so we figured everything was normal and sometimes serial communication just does not work, sadly that was not the case. Now that we have been working with Arduinos for well over a year now the issue that we ran into was something none of us had ever seen before. It seems as if the UART on the Arduino we were using would sometimes stop working, we discovered this so close to the deadline our mechanical solution was more of a desperate attempt to get the project working to a degree better than bare minimum. Looking back through all of the trouble we faced I think nearly all of the teams learned a valuable lesson in starting much earlier on complicated projects like this. It may be a bad habit that rolled over from undergrad or the nature of this online semester but if we discovered this problem weeks ago we would probably still be using the Pi and image processing. With that said a check in on progress weekly might be the best way to ensure that teams are keeping steady progress on their projects. In terms of the actual competition lab we don't think that anything else needs to be changed. The open ended nature of this lab is what we think drove most students to engineering. The ability to go from the ground up and being able to justify why you chose each part, wrote each line of code and then finally see the final product do what you designed it for is one of the most satisfying parts of this class.</p>
